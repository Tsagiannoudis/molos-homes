                Thassos, in comparison to the rest of the Greek islands, is quite underdeveloped and offers incredible opportunities for those with an interest of building or buying a home in the sun on one of the most beautiful and unspoiled islands of the Mediterranean.
            </p>
            <p>
                As more and more people discover Thassos, Greeks and foreigners alike, it is becoming more and more popular among retirees searching for a new home in a quiet and healthy environment and family vacationers who love travelling to Greece regularly.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a warm and sunny climate, lush green mountains surrounded by the sparkling blue Aegean, an abundancy of Greek culture, countless beaches and nature trails, increasing business opportunities and only a 35 minute ferry ride from the European mainland, Thassos is ideal for those seeking a better way of life, in the short or long term.
